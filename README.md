# interest-rate-project
Problem statement: Predict the interest rate on the loan given pertaining parameters related to loan. Build machine learning/statistical models in R to predict the interest rate assigned to a loan.
Few words:
Read all the way through the instructions. Code must be submitted in R and write-ups in a PDF. Feature engineering is very important that helps us to evaluate your creativity and model performance as well
Clean the data with whatever method(s) you believe is best/most suitable. Explore all preprocessing techniques
Visualizations is very important. Data scientist must speak in terms of numbers of visualizations.
Try to extract some more features from text (Variable: “X16”). Build word cloud for X16 variable to understand the major reasons.
Please build two distinctly different machine learning/statistical models in R to predict the interest rate assigned to a loan. When writing the code associated with each model, please have the first part to develop model and save the model, followed by a second part that loads and applies the model on test data.
Predict the interest rates using the data found within the "Holdout for Testing" file. Save the results of the two models in two different files
Submit your work: Please submit all of your code for cleaning, prepping, and modeling your data, your "Results" file, a brief write-up comparing the pros and cons of the two modeling techniques you used. You do not need to submit the original data back to us. Your work will be scored on techniques used (appropriateness and complexity), model performance - measured by MAPE - on the data hold out, an understanding of the two techniques you compared in your write-up, and your overall code.
Apart from accuracy and predicted values, extract some insights from data and build some recommendations.
Good Luck!!!
